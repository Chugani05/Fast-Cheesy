## Description
This is a project for a restaurant website called "Fast & Cheesy!!", developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The page features an interactive menu with various food options, such as pizzas, burgers, and pastas, each with descriptions and prices. The dishes are accompanied by eye-catching images and reservation buttons to facilitate customer interaction. Additionally, it includes a reservation form where users can submit their requests, along with contact options via phone, email, and social media.

The design is responsive and appealing, with a dark color scheme, leveraging Bootstrap for an optimized user experience. The page also includes a footer with information about the restaurant, contact details, hours of operation, and social media links, all in a simple and modern layout.
